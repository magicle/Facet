What is Facet?
Facet is an unobservable transport for social video sites. Facet evades detection by Internet censors by streaming social videos over Skype calls, and applying a novel traffic-analysis countermeasure called video morphing.

How to use?
1. add Skype ID of the Facet server into your contact. 
2. Send video URLs to the Facet server by Skype messages (or by email). 
3. Accept the video call request.

Prerequisite: 
(a) Linux operating system, Facet implementation is tested on Ubuntu 12.04 
(b) Skype installed with a valid Skype user account 
(c) Acknowledgement: Facet server is based on the following open source projects: 
Skype4py: a multiplatform Skype API wrapper for Python 
v4l2loopback: a kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices
Gstreamer: a pipeline-based multimedia framework 
youtube-dl: command-line program to download videos 
Facet repository includes a installer for these projects.
