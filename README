What is Facet?

Facet is an unobservable transport for social video sites. Facet evades detection by Internet censors by streaming social videos over Skype calls, and applying a novel traffic-analysis countermeasure called video morphing.

How to use as a client?
1. Add Skype ID of the Facet server into your contact.
2. Send video URLs to the Facet server by Skype messages (or by email).
3. Accept the video call request.
